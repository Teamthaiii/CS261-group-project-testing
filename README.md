## Download Project 
You can install the ~~latest version~~ *Default branch (main)* of this project by **cloning project** using the command:  
>`git clone https://github.com/CSnimiu/cs261-group7-100001`  

To download ***only this*** sub-branch, please use the command:
>`git clone -b profile https://github.com/CSnimiu/cs261-group7-100001` 

or select the download option via **Code > Download Zip** and then extract the zip file to access the working folder.  
  
**If you already have this project branch on your device**, you can use the command to grab the updated version of the project using the command:  
>`git pull origin profile`  


## Install and Running server
The last two lines of the **DockerContainer_NodeJS.dockerfile** file in `server-setup` folder contain the commands used to ***build*** and ***run*** the docker image to create a NodeJS server.  

> **Build**  
>`docker build -f server-setup/DockerContainer_NodeJS.dockerfile -t node-js-image .`  

> **Run**  
>`docker run -d --name node-js --network mynetwork -p 3000:3000 node-js-image`

***Note that:*** these commands only work properly if you build the docker file in the same location as the `frontend` and `server-setup` folders, so use the code with caution.
